# JavaFXCustomSliders

The goal of this project is to implement JavaFX range pickers, because such components are not available in the default JavaFX library.

One of the primary objective was also to more precisely provie some "Color Range Pickers", and so such components to select colors randomly in HSB or RGB ranges should be made available soon.
